use ubuntu / linux. windows cost a lot of resources

使用greedy算法来修补offspring

penalty function: what degree should I use, like I use tournement selection  to choose 2 parents, then use crossover and mutation to generate 2 offspring, these offspring may not cover the

1. spp or set cover

2. benchmark reference

3. repair

4. **********standard BGA use stotistic ranking？or set a fixed coefficient in panalty function,

5. hyper parameters setting, generation, population setting

6. stotistic ranking: smallest cost function item finaly stiill have some results violate the constrains

7.  start with a feasible one for SA? not feasible, how to solve? 可以是set cover

8. start with a feasible one? means that we need to start with a solution that cover all of the elements and only cover ones?
