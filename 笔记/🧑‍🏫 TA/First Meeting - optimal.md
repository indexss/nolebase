## **Project Overview**
- The project consists of **six tasks**, divided into:
    - **Three individual tasks** (prefix: **S**)
    - **Three team milestones** (prefix: **M**)
- Although individual tasks (S) carry fewer points, they form the foundation for their corresponding M tasks, so take care

## **TA Responsibilities & Schedule**
- It is a shame that we just have 8 TAs this year, but we have about 80 teams this year, meaning each TA is responsible for about **10 teams**. This results in a **high workload**.
- Each team must have a **15-20 minute meeting** with their TA **once per week**.
- The typical meeting structure from past years:
	- **Two meetings per week**: 1 with TA and 1 without TA
- **Meeting Format**
	- Highly recommend you guys to have in-person meetings with your teammates, and have Zoom meetings with me due to the **high workload**. This allows for better time management and ensures that I can assist more teams efficiently.
	- I also have a **toolchain** that helps **organize and summarize your meetings and questions**, making it easier for to escalate concerns to the **Module Leader**.
	- Also OK to have meetings in person, but time slot is very limited.
	- Each week you guys will receive a link,
