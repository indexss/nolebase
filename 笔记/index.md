# Résumé
Hello! I'm **Linli Shi (史林立)**, also known as **Larry** among my English-speaking friends, and **indexss** online. I am currently a third-year student at the [University of Birmingham, UK](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), studying at the School of Computer Science, where I also serve as a TA in *Team Project Lesson*.

### 🎓 Education  
I am currently pursuing a dual Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. My academic journey began at [Central South University, China](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2021 and will conclude at the [University of Birmingham, UK](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/) in 2025. Throughout these four years at CSU and UoB, I have consistently received scholarships. Given the unique nature of my dual-degree program, I am preparing for graduate applications for Fall 2026, considering both Master's and PhD programs.

### 🔬 Research
I specialize in the subfield of **Gaze Estimation** within Computer Vision. Currently, I work as an **RA** at the [Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://hyungjinchang.wordpress.com) in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. I have successfully reproduced several SoTA models for video-based gaze estimation and plan to release them on GitHub after the paper is approved. Additionally, I am interested in the applications of multimodal methods and LLMs in computer vision tasks, and I am actively conducting related research.

For student academic activities, I serve as the Technical Consultant for the CSU Apple Club, where I am responsible for organizing peer academic support and leading open-source development workshops.

### 💼 Experience
**Teaching Assistant (TA), University of Birmingham**  
_Team Project Lesson_
- Guided groups of students in collaborative software development projects, offering mentorship on project management, coding best practices, and teamwork.

**Research Assistant (RA), Intelligent Robotics Lab**  
_University of Birmingham_
- Collaborated with faculty and postgraduate researchers on cutting-edge projects in **computer vision** and **robotics**.
### ⭐ Projects
**🤖 oh-my-vgaze**: Focus on transforming SoTA gaze estimation models from top-tier conferences into video-based versions.
- Adapted and implemented several prominent models, including **EFE, FullFace, GazeNet, GazeTR, Gaze360, EyeNet**, and **FaceNet**, for **video-based gaze estimation**, leveraging temporal information to improve performance on video data.
- Conducted comprehensive **benchmark tests** on well-known datasets **EVE** and **EyeDiap**, analyzing the effectiveness of video-based model transformations compared to the original static versions.
- Assessed model performance improvements by incorporating **sequential frame analysis**, resulting in more robust gaze tracking under real-world video scenarios, with the results to be published on GitHub after paper acceptance.

**🤖 Point Distribution Alignment Loss (PDA Loss)**: A general video-based gaze estimation sequence optimization loss function.
- By leveraging sequential information, the predicted gaze trajectory is aligned with the actual trajectory, increasing the accuracy of video-based gaze estimation.
- The Procrustes distance of trajectory decreased by **0.02**.


**[☕ Backseat](https://github.com/indexss/Backseat):** a novel application designed to facilitate music sharing and discovery between users.
- Mainly responsible for the vertical slicing of the Leaderboard and Album details.
- Innovatively implemented dynamic loading from scratch, combined with Angular's page location identification, step-by-step loading data from the database, reducing server load.
- Deploy Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, team collaboration follows agile development mode.

**📟 Vanilla Firewall**: a robust server-client system designed to manage and enforce firewall rules effectively.
- Designed and implemented a **multi-threaded server** using socket programming to efficiently manage firewall rules and respond to client queries, ensuring concurrent request handling. **Written in C.**
- Created a **client application** that communicates seamlessly with the server, allowing for operations like adding, deleting, and verifying firewall rules, and effectively listing stored rules.
- Emphasized **robust error handling** and memory management, ensuring all client-server interactions are accurate, while avoiding memory leaks and improving long-term server reliability.
