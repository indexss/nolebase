站在机器学习理论与工程落地的交界处，我相信，我们这个时代的自动驾驶研究来到了一个转折点。CV 的进步让“看见”不再稀缺，难点变成了长尾场景下进行多模态融合，时序建模以及不确定性校准，并把它们落到轨迹预测的指标上。基于我在计算机视觉与视频时序研究上的经验，我希望在 USC Viterbi 工程学院深造，学习可落地的自动驾驶系统。

## **P2 ：学术/研究证据（挑1–2个最强）**

学术方面，在中南大学的第二年，我选修了 Artifical Intelligence 课程，并深深被机器学习的美感和力量所吸引。于是在大二的下学期，我申请加入了鲁鸣鸣教授的实验室作为 RA，系统学习深度学习并夯实编程能力。我参与了一段行人，船只重识别的研究，进行多场学术报告，并参与基于 3D 渲染的合成数据集构建。在这段经历中，我逐渐意识到，我需要国际交流以及学术平台来拓宽我的视野，练习自己的语言能力。于是，我申请 UoB 学位项目并于三年级赴伯明翰大学，兴趣逐渐聚焦 Computer Vision。在大四那年，我在 Prof. Hyung Jin Chang 和 Dr. Yihua Cheng 的共同指导下，主导了一个视频凝视估计项目 RTDNet。我设计了一个 Temporal Difference Module 来捕捉视频多帧中的细微运动差异并进行特征融合，并为 Points of Gaze trajectory 的轨迹对齐设计了 PDA Loss，用于稳定对齐与评估连续轨迹。我的方法在 EVE 数据集上和 EYEDIAP 两个当时可用的 video gaze estimation 数据集上达到了 SoTA。我负责了整个项目从问题提出，pipeline 搭建，baseline 复现，实验设计，最终产出了高分的论文报告。在这些经历中，我打磨了度量学习、时序建模、损失设计与严谨评测等可迁移能力，这些正是我转向自动驾驶感知与预测的底座。

## **P3 ：工程/教学习得（可靠交付）**

工程方面，在伯明翰大学的第一年，我参与了 LI Team Project Module。课程中，我们注意到 Spotify 的社交属性较弱，于是团队采用 Agile Development 方法论，结合 Spotify Developer API，利用 Spring Boot 与 Angular 开发了一个增强型的 Spotify 网站。我主要负责 Leaderboard、用户评论模块以及 CI/CD 管道的搭建，最终项目以 90 分的高分收尾。这不仅锻炼了我的实现与协作能力，也让我初步意识到工程规范在复杂项目中的重要性。

为了进一步思考工程协作与系统实现，我在 Final Year 担任了该课程的助教。我负责实验课解决学生技术问题：包括环境设置、依赖/版本冲突、构建和运行时错误、Git合并冲突以及测试失败。我也负责与 42 名学生组织每周例会，帮助团队明确任务与进度。在这一过程中，我锻炼了 问题定位、跨团队协调和工程技术支持 的能力，也进一步加深了对协作开发规范的理解。这些经历让我形成了一个清晰的认知：工程能力不仅体现在实现功能，更在于确保系统能够稳定、可复现地落地。这与自动驾驶的研发逻辑高度契合——性能提升之外，稳定的工程闭环、可复现实验和清晰的协作机制，才是系统在复杂城市场景中真正落地的关键。

## **P4 为什么是自动驾驶、为什么是现在**

我最初被 CV 吸引，是因为它带来一种直观的成就感，模型能把抽象的数字转化为具体的图像，这让我很快投入其中。但在研究过程中我渐渐意识到，“看见”只是起点，真正让我着迷的是：机器如何在人类社会下中理解互动、预测未来。自动驾驶恰好浓缩了这一挑战——它要求在多主体交互与不确定性下，做到可验证的感知与预测。带着这样的兴趣，我希望把自己在视频时序建模和损失函数设计上的经验，延伸到自动驾驶中的轨迹预测与安全评估。同时，我也清楚自身的短板：缺乏对机器人学基础、轨迹预测建模、不确定性评估的系统化训练。如果能在硕士阶段通过课程与研究补齐这些能力，就能把我在视觉上的优势与工程经验，真正延伸到自动驾驶这一完整的感知—预测链条之中。

## **P5 为什么 USC Viterbi，为什么选择项目？**

我选择 USC Viterbi 工程学院，是因为这里为自动驾驶提供了完整而优秀的学习与研究环境。课程方面，像 CSCI 574 Computer Vision 和 EE/CSCI 545 Robotics 这样兼顾视觉与机器人学的课程，能够帮助我在感知、预测和控制等环节上系统补齐短板。研究方面，USC AutoDrive Lab ，RASC 等实验室则有着良好的自动驾驶研究环境。此外，Waymo 等公司已经在洛杉矶实现商业化落地，让我看好 LA 的自动驾驶氛围。正因如此，我相信 USC Viterbi 将是我从视觉研究迈向自动驾驶感知与预测的理想平台。

## **P6 近期计划与职业目标**

硕士阶段，我准备继续学习 AI 与自动驾驶方面的课程，并寻求自动驾驶相关实习，为后续发展打下良好基础。在短期内，我希望成为一名专注于感知与预测的自动驾驶工程师推动算法在真实环境中的稳健落地。长期来看，我希望能带领团队构建可靠、可解释、可扩展的感知与预测系统，使自动驾驶真正能够在复杂城市交通中稳定运行。

## P7 点题

因此，我坚信，USC Viterbi Engineering 的培养将对我达成职业目标发挥不可或缺的作用。我真诚希望能够获得录取机会，在这一学术共同体中继续成长。

工程方面，在伯明翰大学的第一年，我参与了 LI Team Project Module。课程中，我们注意到 Spotify 社交属性较弱，于是团队采用 Agile Development 方法论，结合 Spotify Developer API 利用 Spring Boot 生态与 Angular 开发了一个 Spotify 增强网站。我主要负责了 Leaderboard，用户评论模块以及 CI/CD 管道的搭建，最后项目获得了 90 分的高分。这段经历不仅锻炼了我的工程实现能力，也让我第一次认真思考 AI 在工程中的应用边界。我发现，如果无方法、无约束地直接依赖 AI 生成代码，往往会带来风格冲突、冗余实现和沟通成本上升，甚至削弱团队的效率。为了寻找 AI in the loop 的最佳答案，我在 Final Year 申请成为了同一模块的 TA。我负责实验课解决学生技术问题：包括环境设置、依赖/版本冲突、构建和运行时错误、Git合并冲突以及测试失败。我也负责与 42 名学生组织每周例会，在与学生的交流中，我观察到他们普遍依赖 AI 生成代码，却常常忽视整合与验证。因此我推动了一套轻量化的 AI 使用约束：在团队内设置普遍的纲领性 Prompt，为每个任务分配清晰的完成定义，并明确规定学生使用 AI 的边界，即当遇到技术困难时，允许把自然语言转为可读代码片段，而不是直接产出完整项目。实践表明，这些做法让协作更顺畅，返工更少，学生也在教评中反馈这种方式帮助他们“用 AI 学习”，而非一味阻止使用 AI，或 让 AI 替代人类思考。这段经历让我形成了一条朴素的工程信念：AI 必须以可约束、可协作、可验证的方式进入工程闭环，才能稳定创造价值。对我而言，这和自动驾驶的研发逻辑高度契合——在感知与轨迹预测中，性能提升不是唯一目标，复现实验、清晰评测和对不确定性 AI 的控制才是确保系统在复杂城市场景中真正落地的关键。

Standing at the intersection of machine learning theory and engineering practice, I believe that our era’s autonomous driving research has reached an inflection point. With computer vision advancing rapidly, the bottleneck is no longer “seeing,” but integrating multiple modalities under long-tail scenarios, modeling temporal dynamics, calibrating uncertainty, and translating all these into trajectory prediction metrics. Based on my research experience in computer vision and temporal modeling, I aspire to deepen my understanding and broaden my capabilities at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, focusing on deployable autonomous driving systems.

  

Standing at the intersection of machine learning theory and engineering implementation, I believe that autonomous driving research in this era has reached a turning point. Advances in computer vision seem to have made “seeing” no longer a severe bottleneck, more challenges now lie in integrating multiple modalities under long-tail scenarios, modeling temporal dynamics, calibrating uncertainty, and translating these capabilities into trajectory prediction metrics. Based on my research experience in computer vision and temporal modeling, I aspire to deepen my understanding and broaden my capabilities at USC Viterbi School of Engineering, focusing on reliable autonomous driving systems.

My academic journey began at Central South University, where a second-year Artificial Intelligence course revealed to me the elegance and power of machine learning. Motivated by this fascination, I joined Professor Mingming Lu’s lab as a research assistant, systematically studying deep learning and sharpening my programming skills. I participated in projects on pedestrian and vessel re-identification, delivered multiple academic presentations, and engaged in the construction of synthetic datasets using 3D rendering techniques. These experiences not only strengthened my technical foundations but also made me aware of my limitations: to tackle cutting-edge challenges, I needed a broader platform, better access to resources, and stronger academic communication skills. This realization prompted me to apply to the University of Birmingham’s degree program and spend my junior year abroad. 

My academic journey began during my second year at Central South University, where I took an Artificial Intelligence course and was deeply captivated by the elegance and power of machine learning. Motivated by this, I applied to join Prof. Mingming Lu's lab as a research assistant, systematically studying deep learning and sharpening my programming skills. I participated in projects on pedestrain and vessel re-identification, delivered multiple academic presentations, and engaged in the construction of synthetic datasets using 3D rendering techniques. These experiences not only strengthened my academic foundations, but also made me realize my own limitations: to participate in cutting-edge research, I needed to join a broder platform with better access to resources, and immersive opportunity to practice my communication skills. This prompted me to apply for the University of Birmingham's degree program and spend my last two years of my undergraduate studies abroad.

Immersed in an English-speaking academic environment, I refined my language skills and research communication abilities, collaborated with peers from different cultural and technical backgrounds, and gained exposure to more rigorous research methodologies. My interests gradually converged on computer vision. Under the joint supervision of Prof. Hyung Jin Chang and Dr. Yihua Cheng, I led a final-year project on video gaze estimation, RTDNet. I designed a Temporal Difference Module to capture fine-grained motion differences across frames and fused them into a recurrent architecture, and introduced a custom PDA Loss to align points-of-gaze trajectories for stable sequence evaluation. Our method achieved state-of-the-art results on EVE and EYEDIAP, the two main datasets available at the time. Throughout the project, I was responsible for every stage—from problem formulation to pipeline design, baseline reproduction, experiment planning, and report writing. These experiences honed transferable skills in metric learning, temporal modeling, loss function design, and rigorous evaluation, which now serve as the technical foundation for my shift toward perception and prediction in autonomous driving.

In the new environment, my interests gradually shift to conputer vision. Under the joint supervision of Prof. Hyung Jin Chang and Dr. Yihua Cheng, I led a video gaze estimation project, RTDNet. I designed a Temporal Difference Module to capture subtle movements of face muscle across frames, and fused them using a novel recurrent architechture. I also introduced a new loss function, Point Distribution Alignment (PDA) Loss, to align points-of-gaze trajectories for better sequence alignment. My method achieved state-of-the-art results on both EVE and EYEDIAP datasets, the two main datasets available at the time. In the project, I was responsible for whole steps, from problem formulation, pipeline setup, baseline reprofuction, experiment design to the final high-score research report. Through this experiences, I honed transferable skills in metric learning, temporal modeling, loss function design, and evaluation, which form the foundation for my transition toward perception and prediction in autonomous driving.  

At Birmingham, I also developed an appreciation for the engineering side of computer science. In the LI Team Project Module, our group identified Spotify’s weak social features and decided to build an enhanced platform using its Developer API. We adopted Agile principles and implemented the system with Spring Boot and Angular. I was responsible for the leaderboard, user comments, and the CI/CD pipeline. The project received a final grade of 90/100, but more importantly, it taught me how systematic engineering practices and collaboration are critical to delivering reliable systems. To deepen this perspective, I returned to the same module as a teaching assistant in my final year. I helped students troubleshoot technical problems during lab sessions: environment setup, dependency and version conflicts, build and runtime errors, Git merge issues, and failing tests. I also organized weekly meetings with 42 students, helping teams clarify goals and track progress. These tasks sharpened my debugging, coordination, and mentoring skills, and deepened my understanding of collaborative workflows. I learned that engineering is not only about implementing features; it is about ensuring that systems are stable, reproducible, and maintainable. This mindset resonates strongly with the challenges in autonomous driving, where consistent engineering pipelines and reproducible experiments are just as critical as algorithmic performance.

  

In addition to academics, I also sharpend my engineering skiils at University of Birmingham. In the LI Team Project Module, my group indentified Spotify's weak social features, and decided to build an enhanced web platform using its Developer API. We adopted Agile development principles and implemented the app with Spring Boot and Angular. I was responsible for the leaderboard, user reviews and the CI/CD pipeline. The project concluded with a high grade of 90/100, but more importantly, it tought me how crucial systematic engineering practices and collaboration are for delivering a reliable system. To deepen this perspective, I served as a teaching assistant for this course during my final year. I helped students resolving technical probleams during the lab sessions: environment setup, dependency conflicts, runtime errors, etc. I was also responsible for organizing weekly meetings with more than 40 students, helping teams clarify goals and tackle their cooperation issues. I also participated in developing guidelines for the use of LLM in the course, guiding students on how to properly leverage AI to enhance their project capabilities. These tasks sharpened my debugging, coordination and mentoring skills, and deepened my understanding of engineering workflows. I realized that enginerring is not only about implementing featuresl it's more about ensuring that systems are stable, reproducible, and maintainable. This mindset aligns closely with the challenges in autonomous drving, where consistent engineering pipelines and reproducible experiments are equally critical as algorithmic performance.  

Computer vision first attracted me with its visual intuition: turning numbers into meaningful images. But I soon realized that “seeing” is just the beginning. What truly fascinates me is enabling machines to understand interactions and predict the future in human-centered environments. Autonomous driving condenses this challenge: it requires perception and prediction under uncertainty, with safety and reliability as non-negotiable goals. I see my previous experience in temporal modeling and loss design as highly relevant to trajectory prediction and risk evaluation. However, I am also aware of my current gaps: I lack formal training in robotics foundations, trajectory forecasting, and uncertainty quantification. A master’s program now would allow me to bridge these gaps systematically, extend my vision skills to autonomous driving, and position myself to contribute meaningfully to this rapidly evolving field.

What initially drew me to computer vision was its visual intuition: models could transform abstract numbers into concrete images. However, as I delved deeper into my research, I gradually realized that "seeing" was just the beginning. What truly fascinates me is enabling machines to understand interections and predict the future within human-certered environmnts. Autonomous driving condeneses this challenge: it requires verifiable perception and prediction under uncertainty, with safety and reliability as non-negotiable goals. I believe my experience in temporal modeling and loss function design is highly relevant to trajectory prediction and risk evaluation. However, I am also aware of my current gaps: I lack training in robotics fundations, trajectory forecasting and uncertainty quantification. A master's program could allow me to brige these gaps systematically, extend my visual skills and engineering experience into autonomous driving, and enable me to make mearningful contributions in this repidly evolving field.
