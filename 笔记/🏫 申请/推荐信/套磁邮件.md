Dear Professor Hyung Jin Chang,

Thank you very much for agreeing to serve as my reference.

In addition to listing you as my reference, most of the universities I am applying to are in the US, and their application systems will send you an email with a secure link through which you can upload a recommendation letter.

If it would be helpful, I would be happy to prepare a draft letter for your review, so as to save you time. Please feel free to let me know your preference.

Best regards,  
Linli Shi

我主要申请的院校为美国院校，对于美国那边，申请系统到时会向您的 email 发送一个包含 link 的邮件，您需要在 link 中写一封推荐信。

推荐信请问老师是自己亲自写，我也可以提供一个 draft，节约您的时间

Dear Professor Hyung Jin Chang,

我是 Linli Shi，我已经写好了推荐信草稿，已经附在了附件里面，有 Word 和 PDF 两个版本。

我计划在明天下午（伦敦时间 8 月 20 日下午）通过各个学校的申请系统向您发送约 5 个推荐信链接，它们包括：

约翰霍普金斯大学

卡耐基梅隆大学

南加州大学，特别的，由于我在南加大申请了 3 个专业，所以您会收到南加大的 3 个推荐信链接。

如果您能帮我，我就感谢，谢谢！

Dear Professor Hyung Jin Chang,

This is Linli Shi. Thank you again for kindly agreeing to be my referee.

I have completed a draft recommendation letter and attached both Word and PDF versions for your review.

On **20 August (London time)**, you should receive about **five recommendation request links** from the application systems of:

- Johns Hopkins University
- Carnegie Mellon University
- University of Southern California (three separate requests, as I am applying to three USC programs)

These universities represent only part of the programs I am applying to, but since their deadlines are relatively early, with the earliest on **31 August 2025**, so I am sending you this batch first. There may be a few more schools later, and I hope it will not cause you too much inconvenience.

Thank you very much for your kind support, and please let me know if you encounter any difficulty.

Best regards,  
Linli Shi
