## Dynamic Charts

随着时间会变化的图表，就是 Dynamic。体现了一段时间内各组数据的变化趋势，而且变化趋势会有分别，比如长得快，长得慢，跌的快，跌的慢。

有的题，一些年份一些数据是缺省的，怎么处理？

怎么变得，变化里面有没有相同和不同，需要放到一组。

Diff & Common in Trends, 动态图体现趋势，我们要对比趋势的相同和不同

蓝色上升快，红色上升慢，两组，还有缺省数据

The table shows the proporation of households in Britain that owned different consumer durables between 1972 to 1983. Overall, the period saw upwards trends for ownership of all listed goods. Some products were widely owned from the beginning, while others started with a lower base.

According to the table, television, vaccum cleaner, refrigerator and washing machine shared big ownership bases. For television, the start point was 93%. Then it grew steadily until the end of the period, reached 98% in 1983. Similar to TV, vaccum cleaner started from 87% in 1972 and hit 95% in 1982. Washing machine and refrigerator had reletively lower start points. The percentage of washing machine increased gradually from 66% in 1972 to 75% in 1978, and decreased slighly by 1% in 1979. Then resumed going up and reached 80% in 1983. For refrigerator, the upward trend was stable, from 73% in 1972 to 94% in 1983.

For central heating and telephone, despite they shared relatively lower start points, 37% and 42% in 1972 seperately, the increase treads were stable. Central heating reached 64% eventrully in 1983, while telephone got 77% by the end of listed period.

Finally, for video recorders and dishwasher, there were some incomplete data, reflecting the later adoption. The ownership rate of video recorders was 18% in 1983. For dishwasher, the rate was 3% in 1978, and climb slowly. It finally reached 5%.

Summary：

注意，大多数小作文都是过去式！

- 这个表描述了什么

- The line graph demonstrates the main motivations people expressed for relocating to countryside from the urban area of a capital city in 1990, 2000 and 2010 (between a year and b year). 

- 总体趋势

- The years witnessed a large number of people moving away.

Group 1：

- 为什么这么分组？

- According to the graph, the major reason for relocation was the rising cost of living. (起点) In 1990, 65,000 people left the city because of this, then the number peaked at 85,000 in 2000 (登峰), before going down a bit by 5000 in the decade between 2000 and 2010. （终点）
- 起点是 65000，在 2000 年登峰 85000，然后十年内下降了 5000。
- 起点，终点，关键转折点（转折点不用都说），高点，低点，交汇点。

- 组内比较和特色

Group 2：

- 为什么这么分组？

- It was a different story for traffic and lifestyle: both had the same number of city leavers at 20000 at the start of the period, much lower than which of rising cost of living. Subsequently, both categories saw increases, with traffic first going up to 35000 by the year 2000, and then even more steeply to 60000 in 2010. Lifestyle leavers rose consistantly over the whole period, going eventually up to 40000.

- 总体趋势：美国下降，日本上升，美国起点高，日本起点低，最终相似。
- 分组：两组
- 对称不要说对称，而是说，seems to move in opposite directions。、

This line graph demonstrates(illustrates) the unemployment rates in the US and Japan between March 1993 and March 1999. Overall, the years witnessed a decline in unemployment rates in the US while a rise in Japan. The two curve moved in opposite directions, and by the end of the period, both countries converged at the same level.

According to the graph, the US recorded the highest unemployment rates of 7.0% in March, 1993. From March 1993 to March 1996, the unemployment rate fell gradually, with minor fluctuations. Subsequently, the curve tended to flatten, and eventrually stablised around 5.0% in March 1999.

It was a different story for Japan. Started at 3.0%, much lower than that of the US, the unemployment rates rose steadily to roughly 4.5% from March 1993 to March 1996. After that, the upward trend continued and peaked at above 5.0% between March 1998 and March 1999. By the end of this period, the curve converged to 5.0%, which is almost identical with the US.

## Static Charts

没有时间变化，只有一个维度的表格就是 Static

![](assets/47de465693c312bfb7dd6f169e4a9555_MD5.webp)

可以把 single 放一组，couple 放一组。总而言之要放一组，分类找规律。动态图也要放一组。

- 单身比不单身，贫困几率会更高。
- 有孩子的贫困率高于没有孩子的贫困率
- 老人的贫困率会远低于其他各组

Diff & Common in Quantities，静态图要找到数据栏目中的相同和不同

  

This table demonstrates the percentage of people from different household condition living in poverty. The family types are defined by marriage status, age, and whether they have children or not.

According to the table, single people are more likely to suffer poverty than couples. For family without children, the poverty proportion of single family stood at 19% (359,000) , which is over twice that of couple family. When it comes to aged family, the poverty rate of single aged people was still slightly higher than that of aged couple, which are 6% (54,000) and 4% (48,000), separately.

Another noticeable reason for poverty seems related to children. Data shows that the poverty percentage of couples with children is 5% higher than those who without children, which was recorded as 12% (933,000). The proportion of all households family was also 4% higher than families without children, **which further demonstrates the pattern.** Besides, young parents are more likely to suffer poverty. The poverty proportion of sole-parent families was almost a quarter (21%), which is nearly 4 times as high as that of single aged people.

11. 为什么分组

12. 因为他们是自己买咖啡，占比低

13. 比较，核心观点

14. 买速溶咖啡的比买咖啡豆的多

16. 总结

17. 澳大利亚大多数人都喝咖啡或者茶，而更加青睐方便的方法。

这个题里面分为两组，前两个都是买咖啡自己做，最后一个是别人给做。

对于第二组，体现出了更大的共性，都是最多， SMBH 都超过 50%，然而，A 低于 50%。说明了，去店里喝咖啡，比自己做咖啡，冲咖啡更普遍

对于第一组，都较少，对于自己做咖啡，和速溶咖啡更普遍。

  

This bar chart illustrates the coffee and tea buying and drinking preferences of 5 cities in Australia. It shows the proportions of residents in these cities who bought fresh coffee, instant coffee or went to cafe to grab a coffee or tea in last 4 weeks.

According to the chart, most residents in these cities went to grab a coffe or tea in a cafe. Over 60% in Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, and around 55% in Brisbane. In these cities, the proporations of buying coffee from cafe are much higher than those who buy fresh or instant coffee. Adelaide is an exception, with slightly less than half, also 1 or 2 percentage lower than its people who bought instant coffee.

Among those who bought coffee, around half of the residents in these cities would choose instant coffee. However, the percentage differences veries. In Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart, the residents who purchased instant coffee are around twice of who chose fresh coffee. While in Sydney and Melbourne, the gap was smaller, just around 2% in Sydney and 10% in Melbourne.

In conclusion, most residents in the cities listed here in Australian drink coffe or tea, and they seems to prefer convinient ways such as buying from a coffee shop or buying instant coffee. Fewer people choose to buy fresh coffee and make by themselves.

The pie charts demonstrates the news accressing ways in the UK and Brazil. Overall, this two nations show similar patterns, while there are also some differences, both significant and minor.

One of the noticeable features shared by these two countries is that the share of accessing news by TV is big (is the large share of people who get news from television.). With about two fifth of the population in the UK perfer this way whereas only 3% fewer in Brazil. In the meantime, accessing news online accounts for the largest proportion among all categories in Brazil, which stood at 53%. In the UK, this category shares less proporation, which is 35%, but it was still a mainstream news source.

For other categories, the similar pattern also appears. In both of these two countries, people prefer reading print media for news over listening to radio. However, differences also exist. In the UK, the print media category accounts for 15%. It is more than twice as high as that of radio's share. While in Brazil, the gap is less obvious. The print media is recorded as 6%, only 4% higher than the radio's proporation.

In conclusion, the methods to access news in both of these contries are dominated by TV and online ways, while UK has a bit more diversity in how people access news.

The pie charts show the principle ways of finding out the news in two different countries, the UK and Brazil. The two nations show broadly similar patterns, though there are some differences, both significant and minor.

One of the most prominent features shared by the two pies is that apparently viewing TV news is popular in both countries - with about two fifths of the UK population favoring this mode of delivery and only 3% fewer in Brazil; in the meantime, in the UK over a third of people access the news online, while in Brazil the figure is more than half at 53%.

Differences between the UK and Brazil include: 1. over twice as many people read the news in print in the former, compared with the latter, at 15% and 6% respectively; 2. Similarly, listening to the news on the radio is preferred by three times more people in the UK than in Brazil, though both counting for a minor share of the whole population.

Overall, both countries are dominated by internet and TV in the way how news is conveyed, while the UK has a bit more diversity in how people access news.

动态静态小结：

数据图标一般有四种：表格，饼状图，柱状图，折线图。

其中，表格，饼状图，柱状图可以是动态，也可以是静态

而折线图一定是动态，描述趋势。

当看到散点图 scatter 的时候，不要过度解读，只是折线图的一种区分线条的方式罢了。

## Mixed Charts

动态和静态结合起来，或者多张图放在一块。

把每张图的特点写出来，然后看看能不能找到关系当结尾。

填充细节：

- 每一步的目的是什么
- 每一步发生了什么步骤
- 形状，尺寸，特性
- 每个步骤之间的关系
